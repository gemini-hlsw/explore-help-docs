## Time Accounting

This table provides a top-level summary of the program time accounting.

The `Prepared` column is the sum of the estimated durations of all defined observations, without taking into account `OR` groupings.  This includes time for nighttime calibrations such as embedded arcs and flats, as well as the spectrophotometric standards in the Calibrations group.  When the band of the standard is ambiguous, i.e. it is associated with observations in multiple bands, the time for the standard is assigned to the lowest band.

The `Used` column sums the time charged in each band.

The `Completion` is calculated as Used / Award.

*The `No Band` column corresponds to observations that have an unassigned band.
