## Data Sharing

The Data Sharing table lists all the people who have access to proprietary science data from this program via the [Gemini Observatory Archive](https://archive.gemini.edu).
The list is pre-populated with all Co-Investigators and program support staff.
The PI may also add new users using the invitation process.

Note that Co-Is and Support staff cannot be deleted from this table, but their privliges may be revoked by unchecking the box in the `Data Access` column.
