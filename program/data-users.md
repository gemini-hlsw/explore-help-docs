## Data Sharing

The Data Sharing table lists everybody who has access to proprietary sceince data from this program in the [Gemini Observatory Archive](https://archive.gemini.edu).
The list is pre-populated with all Co-Investigators and support staff.
The PI may also add new users using the invitation process and give them access to proprietary data.

Note that Co-Is and Support staff cannot be deleted from this table, but their Data Access privliges may be revoked.
