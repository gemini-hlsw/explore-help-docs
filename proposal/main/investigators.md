## Investigators

The Investigators panel lists all the people who will be listed as collaborators on the proposal.

There are three investigator "roles":
* Principal Investigator
* Full-access Co-Investigator
* Read-Only Co-Investigator

Read-only CoIs are the default when clicking the "Add" button.  They may see all the targets and observations and proposal details, but the only thing that they may change is their own personal details (email address, partner affiliation, etc).

Full-access CoIs, on the other hand, have virtually the same privileges as the PI.  They may edit targets, observations, and proposal details and even invite new read-only CoIs.  The only thing that a full-access CoI can *not* do it change the role of other CoIs.

### Invitations

Co-Investigators are added through an invitation process.  To invite a new CoI, click the add_user button which will add a blank row to the Investigators table and then click the send_invitation button.  This will open a dialog to enter the CoI's email address and send them a single-use key with instructions on how to redeem the key (which requires an ORCiD).  It is recommended to invite all CoIs to let them know that they are a part of the proposal, but it is not required at this time, and invitations do not need to be redeemed before the proposal deadline.

### Email

Explore will query your current email address from ORCiD when you log in to Explore. If you update your email address in ORCiD you can force Explore to update by logging out and back in.  If your email address in ORCiD is not public you will need to manually update your email.

### Partner

Enter your Gemini partner affiliation, and "No Partner" if you are not affiliated with any Gemini partner.

### Thesis

Check the thesis box if you are a student and this proposal will provide data that will a part of your thesis.

### Gender

The gender field is optional and will be used for statistical analysis of the distribution of people using Gemini.
