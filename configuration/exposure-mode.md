## Exposure Mode

Explore currently supports two exposure modes:

1. Signal / Noise:  specify the desired S/N and the wavelength where it should be measured and Explore will calculate the time required.
2. Time & Count: specify the exposure time and the number of exposures and Explore will calculate the resulting S/N.
